A Weather App built using React, which enables users to search for weather conditions in various cities and save them as favorites.

The app relies on the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch weather data and utilizes [Weather Icons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) for displaying weather-related icons. Additionally, [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) was incorporated in the development of this project.
