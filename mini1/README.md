The weather application provides users with accurate and up-to-date weather information for their location and other locations of interest. It offers various features to help users plan their activities and make informed decisions based on the forecast.

Key Features:

Current Weather: The app displays real-time information on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud percentage. Users can easily check the current weather conditions.

Activity Recommendations: Based on the weather conditions, the app suggests suitable activities. For example, on a warm, sunny day, it may recommend outdoor activities like hiking or picnics, while on a cold, cloudy day, it might suggest indoor activities like watching movies or cooking.

The app utilizes an external API, specifically 'https://weather-by-api-ninjas.p.rapidapi.com/v1/weather?city=', to fetch the weather data.

The weather data is processed and displayed using elements such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud percentage.

Users can interact with the application by searching for a city at the top-right. The app will then provide the current weather for that city along with recommended activities.

The application utilizes various JavaScript techniques such as objects, DOM functions, loops, if-else statements, and event handlers.

External tools and libraries such as Bootstrap are used for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the design and functionality of the app.

HTML elements used include forms, divs, headings, a favicon image, and a button.

CSS features employed include imported fonts, classes, background color, and text color.

In the future, the application could be extended by adding another API to display current activities in each city.
